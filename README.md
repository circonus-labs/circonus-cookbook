# Circonus Cookbook

## Features:
   * A library class, Circonus, which acts as a Circonus API v2 client
   * Integration with resmon cookbook (TODO)
   * Chef Resources for:
      * circonus_check_bundle
      * circonus_metric
      * circonus_rule_set
      * circonus_rule
      * circonus_graph
      * circonus_graph_datapoint
   * A default recipe that uses the node attributes to create the above resources
   * Ability to ignore configure API timeout and optionally continue despite API errors

## TODO List

   * Most of the resources do not offer `:delete` actions yet (check_bundle does)
   * Support for graphs in default recipe (attribute walker)
   * Ability to control order of rules
   * LWRP for worksheets

## Recipes

### `circonus` (`circonus::default`)

Optional.  Lets you define circonus check bundles, metrics, and rules via the node's attributes.  See the 'Cookbook Attributes' section for details on the expected attribute structure.

## LWRPs

### circonus_check_bundle

Manages a check bundle on circonus.  Note that you MUST have at least one circonus_metric that refers to the circonus_check_bundle (a limitation of the API).

Actions:
   * **`:create`** - Create/Manage the check bundle
   * **`:delete`** - Delete the check bundle and all its metrics (WARNING: DATA LOSS).

Resource Attributes:

   * **`display_name`** - Display name of bundle, will appear in email subjects.  Uses resource name if not provided.
   * **`target`** - Hostname or IP to query.  Defaults to `node[:circonus][:target]`, which in turn defaults to the node's `guess_main_ip()` according to NetInfo. If NetInfo isn't present, then it defaults to `node[:ipaddress]`.
   * **`type`** - Type of check, like `:resmon` or `:http`
   * **`brokers`** - Array of broker names.  Defaults to `node[:circonus][:default_brokers]`
   * **`tags`** - Array of freeform strings to be used as tags in the web UI.  Default `[ ]`
   * **`config`** - Hash of options specific to the check bundle type.  See [the check bundle API documentation](https://login.circonus.com/resources/api/calls/check_bundle)

Example:

    circonus_check_bundle "foo-host Resmon" do
      type :resmon
      # Note that resmon URL MUST end in slash
      config { 'url' => 'http://foo-host.int.omniti.net:81/', 'port' => 81}
    end

### circonus_metric

Manages a metric on circonus.  Each metric must refer to a previously defined circonus_check_bundle resource.

Actions:
   * **`:create`** - Create/Manage the metric

Resource Attributes:

   * **`name`** - Name of metric.  Consult your check type docs for information on what can go here.  Defaults to resource name.
   * **`type`** - Type of value returned - one of `:text`, `:numeric`, `:composite` or `:histogram`
   * **`check_bundle`** - Name of the check bundle resource that should contain this metric.  Required.

See also: the Circonus::MetricScanner utility library, which helps enumerate available metrics.

Example:

    circonus_metric "Core::Resmon`resmon`configstatus" do
      check_bundle "derm-dev-1 Resmon"
      type :text
    end

### circonus_rule_set

Manages a ruleset on circonus, which allows you to trigger alerts/emails/pages.  Each metric can have 0 or 1 rulesets per broker, and each ruleset may have 0-n rules.  The ruleset gathers together the contact and response information, while the rules define the specific criteria under which the alert(s) will fire.

The name of this resource is arbitrary, but it is suggested that you use 'broker-name/metric-name' since that will be unique.

Actions:
   * **`:create`** - Create/manage the metric

Resource Attributes:

   * **`metric`** - Name of the circonus_metric resource this ruleset will be bound to.  Must be defined prior to the circonus_rule_set .
   * **`broker`** - Name of the circonus broker that is collecting stats for the metric.  You may repeat circonus_rule_sets on the same metric if you specify different brokers.
   * **`contact_groups`** - Ruby hash-of-arrays.  Keys are the strings `1`,`2`, .. `5`, representing the severity levels.    Values are arrays of string names of contact groups; when a rule fires at that severity level, all of the contact groups specified will be notified.  You may omit entries for which you have no contact groups.
   * **`derive`** - Flag indicating whether the metric should be treated as a derivative (ie, watch for changes over time, rather than specific values).  Values are :derive , :counter, or null.
   * **`link`** - An arbitrary URL that will be emailed to contact groups, presumably to assist in incident response.
   * **`notes`** - Arbitrary text that will be shown in the Circonus Web UI, presumably to assist in incident response.

TODO - add parent attribute

Example:

    circonus_rule_set "agent-il-1/Core::Cpu`local`idle" do
       metric "Core::Cpu`local`idle"
       broker "agent-il-1"
       contact_groups '1' => [ "Chef Admins" ], '2' => [ ]
       link 'http://foo.com'
       notes 'The very model of a modern major general'
    end

### circonus_rule

Manages a single circonus rule.  Relies on the circonus_rule_set resource already being defined.

BUG: There is no way to manage order of rules via this resource.  Since the first rule to match wins, order matters.

The name of the resource is arbitrary.

Actions:

   * **`:create`** - Create/manage a circonus rule.

Resource Attributes:

   * **`rule_set`** - Name of a circonus_rule_set chef resource, which must be defined prior to the rule resource.
   * **`criteria`** - Operator to use to detect a match of the rule.  Valid values:
     * **`min value`** - for numeric metrics
     * **`max value`** - for numeric metrics
     * **`match`** - exact match for text metrics
     * **`does not match`** - exact match for text metrics
     * **`contains`** - regex, for text metrics.  If the regex matches, the alert fires.
     * **`does not contain`** - regex, for text metrics.  If the regex does not match, the alert fires.
     * **`on change`** - for text metrics, compares to last detected value
     * **`on absence`** - for all metrics, detects metric loss of signal
   * **`severity`** - Integer severity level, 1-5.  If this rule matches, the contact group(s) assigned in the rule_set to this severity level will be notified.
   * **`value`** - Operand for those criteria that require one.  String.
   * **`wait`** - Integer, delay in minutes to wait before alerting.  Use this to suppress false positives due to transients.

Example:

    circonus_rule "agent-il-1/Core::Cpu`local`idle/25-idle" do
      rule_set "agent-il-1/Core::Cpu`local`idle"
      criteria 'min value'
      value 25
      severity 3
      wait 5
    end

### circonus_graph

Manages a circonus graph.  You can greate a graph independently of any check bundles or metrics.  A graph may have 0 or more graph datapoints, which do rely on metrics.

Name of the resource is used as the graph title.

Actions:

   * **`:create`** - Create/Manage the graph

Resource Attributes:

   * **`id`** - optional, GUID of the graph.  If provided, you can change the name of the graph; if omitted, changing the name of the graph will create a new graph.
   * **`style`** - `:line` or `:area`
   * **`line_style`** - `:stepped` or `:interpolated`
   * **`tags`** - Array of freeform strings to be used as tags in the web UI.  Default `[ ]`
   * **`max_left_y`, `max_right_y`, `min_left_y`, `min_right_y`** - Y Axis limits

### circonus_graph_datapoint

Manages a data series on a graph.  Relies on a circonus_metric resource definition, as well as agrpah definition.  You must also provide the broker name, so we can resolve the check ID.

The name is used as the display name.  The identity of the data point is derived from the metric and the broker.

Actions:

   * **`:create`** - Create/Manage a graph data series

Resource Attributes:

   * **`type`** - `:data`, `:guide`, `:composite` - `:data` by default
   * **`graph`** - name of the circonus_graph chef resource on which to draw the data
   * **`metric`** - name of the circonus_metric chef resource that provides the data
   * **`broker`** - name of the broker, used to identify the check
   * **`axis`** - `:r` or `:l`, which axis the the data should be measured against
   * **`color`** - `#FF00FF` style; if omitted, circonus server will provide a default
   * **`alpha`** - float or integer; 0 - 1; defaults to `0.3`
   * **`data_formula`** - see web UI help; may be left null
   * **`legend_formula`** - see web UI help; may be left null
   * **`hidden`** - true/false, false default
   * **`derive`** - `:counter`, `:derive`, `:gauge` - `:gauge` is default
   * **`stack`** - integer signifying which stack set the datapoint belongs to (greater than or equal to 0) (defaults to nil)

When putting datapoints into a stack, `line_style` must be set on the graph.

In order to create a guide, the following attributes can/should be used:

   * **`type`** - `:guide`
   * **`name`**
   * **`color`**
   * **`hidden`**
   * **`data_formula`** - ie `90000`
   * **`legend_formula`**

For composites, the following attributes can/should be used:

   * **`type`** - `:composite`
   * **`name`**
   * **`color`**
   * **`axis`**
   * **`hidden`**
   * **`data_formula`** - ie `= 100 * A / (A + B)`
   * **`legend_formula`**

## Composite Checks:

Circonus allows for composite checks, where data from multiple metrics can be combined at collection time and aggregated into
a single metric.

   * The broker should always be defined as `composite`
   * The aggregation happens within the Circonus services, not in an
     enterprise broker.
   * The check bundle expects a single circonus_metric to be added to the bundle
   * Composite checks are updated as the source metrics are collected

This last point is important. If you create a graph of composite metrics and play it in real-time, the data will update
as the other metrics run (at their minimum default rate). Often this is 60 seconds, so in real time you will see the data
arrive in discrete chunks distributed across the 60 minute period.

Example:

    circonus_check_bundle "Aggregated Stuffs from Things" do
      type :composite
      brokers ['composite']
      config 'formula' => "stats:sum(metric:counter(tag:thing, \things`stuff\", 60000))",
             'composite_metric_name' => 'things`stuff'
      target 'aggregated-things'
    end

    circonus_metric "things`stuff" do
      type :composite
      check_bundle "Aggregated Stuffs from Things"
    end

See [the docs](https://login.circonus.com/user/docs/Data/CheckTypes#Composite) for more info on composite formulas.

## Utility Library

The cookbook includes a utility class, Circonus::MetricScanner, which provides a way to list the metrics available on a proposed check bundle before it is actually created in circonus.  This is needed for check types that can be configured, like nad and resmon.

Example:

    example_check_bundle_name = "nad demo - MetricScanner"
    circonus_check_bundle example_check_bundle_name do 
       type "json:nad"
       config :url => '/'
    end

    # The metrics list is an Enumerable, so you can filter it.
    nad_metrics = Circonus::MetricScanner.get(resources("circonus_check_bundle[#{example_check_bundle_name}]"))
    nad_metrics.select { |name, type|
       name =~ /^cpu`idle/
    }.each do |metric_name, metric_type|
        circonus_metric metric_name + ' on ' + example_check_bundle_name do
            metric_name metric_name
            check_bundle example_check_bundle_name
            type metric_type
        end
    end

Currently very few check types are supported by MetricScanner - only ping and nad.
